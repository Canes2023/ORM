# ORM

In this assignment, I was tasked to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I have tested everything in Insomnia and it works. All the products, tags, and categories work as well and the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes work as well for each one. Code was provided as a starter code but app wasn't functional. I had to edit the code and add the missing stuff that was needed to make it all work.
